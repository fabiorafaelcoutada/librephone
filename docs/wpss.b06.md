This blob appears to contain multiple files. Since these all look very
similar if you dump the hex, it's also possible that the 
[Binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk) program incorrectly
identifies these. My guess is this is actually a single data
file. Looking at the hex, it's mostly a collection of error
messages. In addition to the errors, for some reason is also lists
filenames, none of which are in the kernel.
