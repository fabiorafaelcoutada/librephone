This is a small, 256 byte file for an unknown architecture. None of
the [tools](tools.md) can identify the architecture. Since it
doesn't disassemble into anything that looks like real assembly, it's
probably a data file. I have tried AARCH32, AARCH64, ATMel AVR8 and
RISC. The data structure used may be in the Qualcomm open source code
release. It's not yet clear if it's 8, 16, 32, or 64 bit.
